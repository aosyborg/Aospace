If you've ever done a lot of OOP you know you have to use a lot of requires and includes
for your code to work. This class attempts to solve this by applying a strict naming
scheme to your classes and where they are placed. As an added bonus, it is written to
extend the Zend Framework Zend_Loader class.

<pre><code>
// Standard PHP
function __autoload($class)
{
	Library_Autoloader::autoload($class);
}

// Zend Framework
Zend_Loader::registerAutoload('Library_Autoloader');
</code></pre>

For this to work you must name your classes <em>Project_Path_To_File_ClassName</em> which would
attempt to load the class <em>ClassName</em> located in <em>Path/To/File/ClassName.php</em>
