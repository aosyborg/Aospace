If you are making a web page of any size, you will no doubt need to make database connections.
But what happens when you have security in mind but don't want to install a big package like
PDO? This database class is a perfect lightweight solution to this answer. To get started
simply input your database connection information into the private fields in the class, then
start making secure database queries!

<pre><code>
public function __construct($database = 'defaultDatabase')
{
	$this->_database = $database;
	$this->_server = 'localhost';
	$this->_username = 'username';
	$this->_password = 'password';
}
</code></pre>
